# Production
production repo for kubernetes (test)

Production RepositoryThis repository serves as the source of truth for Kubernetes application deployments managed by ArgoCD in our testing environment.Use CaseThe primary purpose of this repository is to provide Kubernetes manifest files (YAML definitions) that are automatically synchronized and applied to our Kubernetes cluster by ArgoCD. This allows us to:Test ArgoCD Functionality: Validate ArgoCD's ability to connect to a Git repository, detect changes in manifests, and deploy/synchronize applications to the cluster.Version Control Deployments: Keep our application deployment configurations under version control, enabling tracking of changes, rollbacks, and collaboration.Implement GitOps Principles: Practice the GitOps methodology where the desired state of the cluster is declared in Git, and ArgoCD ensures the cluster state matches the Git state.How it Works with ArgoCDArgoCD is configured to monitor branches (typically main or master) within this repository. When changes are pushed to the monitored branch that affect the Kubernetes manifest files, ArgoCD automatically detects these changes and initiates a synchronization process to update the corresponding applications running in the Kubernetes cluster.Repository StructureThis repository is expected to contain Kubernetes manifest files, typically written in YAML. These files define various Kubernetes resources such as:DeploymentsServices (like the NodePort service you created for ArgoCD)IngressesConfigMapsSecrets (handle sensitive data appropriately, e.g., using sealed secrets or external secrets)Other custom resources (CRDs)Manifest files can be placed directly in the root of the repository or organized into subdirectories based on application or environment.Example:/
├── README.md
├── nginx-proxy-manager-deploy.yaml  # Your NPM deployment file
├── my-app/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── another-app/
    └── ingress.yaml
When configuring an application in ArgoCD, you will point it to this repository and specify the Path to the directory containing the manifests for that specific application (e.g., . for files in the root, or my-app/ for files in the my-app directory).Getting StartedEnsure you have ArgoCD installed and configured in your Kubernetes cluster.Connect this GitHub repository as a source repository in ArgoCD.Create a new ArgoCD Application, pointing it to this repository and the specific path within the repository where your application's manifests reside.Push your Kubernetes manifest files to the appropriate branch in this repository.Observe ArgoCD synchronizing the changes to your cluster.This repository is a key component of our GitOps workflow for managing deployments in our testing environment.
